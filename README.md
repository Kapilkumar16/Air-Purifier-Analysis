# Air-Purifier-Analysis

The Air Purifier Analysis dashboard provides in-depth insights into air filter performance, efficiency, and maintenance status across various locations. It helps monitor key metrics like:

✅ Filter Efficiency – Tracks the effectiveness of different filter types (HEPA, Activated Carbon, Electrostatic, Pre-Filter) over time.
✅ Clogged Filter Status – Indicates whether filters are in good condition or require replacement.
✅ PM2.5 Reduction Efficiency – Analyzes how well each filter type removes fine particulate matter from the air.
✅ Load Factor by Location – Identifies air quality variations in different environments like offices, malls, hospitals, and manufacturing units.
✅ Filter Aging & Performance Trends – Observes how filter efficiency declines over time, helping in proactive maintenance.

This analysis enables data-driven decisions for better air quality, ensuring cleaner and healthier indoor environments.
